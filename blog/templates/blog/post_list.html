      <p> C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose,imperative
	computer programming language, supporting structured programming,
	lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system
	prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs
	that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it
	has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in
	assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various
	application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to
	embedded systems</p>

      <p>C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at
	Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operatingsystem. It has
	since become one of the most widely used programming languages of
	all time, with the C compilers from various vendors available for the
	majority of existing computer architectures and operationg systems.
